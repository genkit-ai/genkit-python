"""One FastAPI server that puts every agent behind an HTTP endpoint.

This is the Python port of the JS testapp's ``index.ts``. Each agent is mounted
with ``serve_agent`` — one ``include_router`` call gives you the turn route plus
its ``/getSnapshot`` and ``/abort`` companions — and plain flows go through
``serve_flow``. The ``prefix='/api'`` at the mount is what puts everything under
``/api/<name>``, so the same web frontend that talks to the Node server talks to
this one unchanged.

    genkit start -- uv run testapp/server.py   # Dev UI (:4000) + API (:8080)

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
