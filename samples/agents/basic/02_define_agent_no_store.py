"""No store: you own the conversation state on the client.

Without a store the agent keeps nothing between sessions — snapshot_id and
session_id stay None. You capture messages + custom state yourself, then hand
them back through chat(messages=..., artifacts=..., state=...) to resume.
Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
