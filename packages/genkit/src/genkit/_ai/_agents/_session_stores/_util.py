"""Storage-agnostic helpers shared by the flat, full-snapshot session stores.

Each turn is persisted whole, keyed by its snapshot id, and the ``parent_id``
links between snapshots form the conversation tree. That single shape covers a
linear chat, a "just give me the latest turn" lookup, and a forked/branching
history without any diffing — so it's the right default for local dev, tests,
and single-process apps. For a multi-instance production deployment, back the
same ``SessionStore`` protocol with a real database (where it's worth trading
this simplicity for incremental, diff-based persistence).

``InMemorySessionStore`` and ``FileSessionStore`` are standalone — they share
the bits here as plain functions rather than a common base class, so each store
is a self-contained read of how its backend works.
