"""Vertex AI Plugin for Genkit.

This plugin provides integration with Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform,
including Model Garden for accessing third-party models and Vector Search
for RAG applications.

Example:
    ```python
    from genkit import Genkit
    from genkit_vertexai.model_garden import ModelGarden

    # 1. Initialize Genkit with the Model Garden plugin
    ai = Genkit(
        plugins=[ModelGarden(project_id='my-project', location='us-central1')],
    )

    # 2. Call models under the modelgarden/ namespace (not vertexai/)
    res = await ai.generate(
        model='modelgarden/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022',
        prompt='Explain recursion in 10 words.',
    )

    # 3. Inspect output shapes directly
    print(res.text)
    # => A function calling itself until reaching a base stopping condition.
    ```

Requirements:
    - Requires Google Cloud Application Default Credentials (ADC) or explicit credentials.
